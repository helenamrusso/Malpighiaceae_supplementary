# Folders

## Qemistree
This folder contains .qzv files for tree visualization, and the Jupyter Notebook for running Qemistree in Qiime2 plugin (more information in https://github.com/biocore/q2-qemistree).

##### Empress visualization
The .zip contains two .qzv files. These .qzv files are the results obtained from the chemical hierarchy analysis (Qemistree), which can be interactively explored in EMPRESS.
To explore the tree results, visit https://view.qiime2.org/ and drag and drop a .qzv file in the marked box. The tree layout, colors, and metadata information
can all be interactively visualized with the menu on the right. For more information about EMPRESS visualization, please visit https://github.com/biocore/empress.
